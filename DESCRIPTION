Description: Test for overall association between microbiome composition data with a continuous or dichotomous outcome via phylogenetic kernels. The phenotype can be univariate continuous or binary phenotypes (Zhao et al. (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.04.003>), survival outcomes (Plantinga et al. (2017) <doi:10.1186/s40168-017-0239-9>), multivariate (Zhan et al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22030>) and structured phenotypes (Zhan et al. (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12684>). For all these effect, the microbiome community effect was modeled nonparametrically through a kernel function, which can incorporate the phylogenetic tree information.
